    <h1>LBW - Little Bit Wiser in Cricket</h1>
    <p>Welcome to LBW, the term generally refers to leg before wicket in the sport of cricket <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket">(see here in Wikipedia)</a>, but I decided to give it a fun turn, using LBW to be short of Little Bit Wiser. You'll see projects related to cricket, the sport I follow, over here.</p>
