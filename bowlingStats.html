    <h2>Bowling Statistics</h2>
    <p>This page will help calculating some of the basic bowling statistics, such as the average, strike rate and economy.</p>
    <h5>Average</h5>
    <p>The bowling average is the number of runs conceded on average to get a wicket <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_average">(via Wikipedia)</a>. So, it'll be runs conceded ÷ wickets taken.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Intrigued? Here we go.</p>
    <div id="box">
        <p id="mydata"></p>
        <button onclick="getBowlingAverage()">Calculate your bowling average!</button>
        <strong><p id="bowlingAvg"></p></strong>
    </div>
    <h5>Strike Rate</h5>
    <p>The bowling strike rate is the average number of deliveries bowled for every wicket taken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate">(via Wikipedia)</a>. So, it'll be deliveries bowled ÷ wickets taken.</p>

        <strong><p id="bowlingSR"></p></strong>
    </div>
    <h5>Economy Rate</h5>
    <p>The economy rate is the average number of runs conceded per over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate">(via Wikipedia)</a>. For example, if a bowler has given 24 runs in 4 overs across a T20 spell, then their economy is 6.00. But that being said, if in some other match in progress, they've given 24 runs in 3 overs, their economy at that point in time is 8.00, but if the fourth and final over sees them getting tonked and smashed around the park for a whopping 26 runs, that means they have now conceded 50 runs across their 4 overs, so their economy is now 12.50 (expensive!).</p>
