    <p>I thought T20 & ODI have different tables, but I guess not. So, my work gets way easier now.</p>

    <p>Anyways, back to the main business. Let's get away in calculating DLS.</p>
    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <p>There are a few different scenarios, involving DLS. It could be one of these:
    <br>
        1. Team 1 has their innings interrupted by rain.
        <br>
        <button id="case1" onclick="getDLS(1)">Figure out your score</button>
        <br>
        2. Team 1 has their innings cut short.
        <br>
        <button id="case2" onclick="getDLS(2)">Figure out your score</button>
        <br>
        3. Team 2 has their innings interrupted by rain.
        <br>
        <button id="case3" onclick="getDLS(3)">Figure out your score</button>
        <br>
        4. Team 2 has their innings cut short.
        <br>
        <button id="case4" onclick="getDLS(4)">Figure out your score</button>
        <br>
        5. Team 2 has their innings interrupted by rain.
        <br>
        <button id="case5" onclick="getDLS(5)">Figure out your score</button>
        <br>
    <div id="targetScore">
        <!-- This is where the target score will be displayed -->    
    </div>
