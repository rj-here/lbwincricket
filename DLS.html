    <p>Anyways, back to the main business. Let's get away in calculating DLS.</p>
    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <p>There are a few different scenarios, involving DLS. It could be one of these:
    <br>
    1. Team 1 has their innings interrupted by rain.
    <button id="case1" onclick="getDLS()">Figure out your score</button>
    <br>
    2. Team 1 has their innings cut short.
    <button id="case2" onclick="getDLS()">Figure out your score</button>
    <br>
    3. Team 2 has their innings interrupted by rain.
    <button id="case3" onclick="getDLS()">Figure out your score</button>
    <br>
    4. Team 2 has their innings cut short.
    <button id="case4" onclick="getDLS()">Figure out your score</button>
    <br>
    5. Team 2 has their innings interrupted by rain.
    <button id="case5" onclick="getDLS()">Figure out your score</button>
